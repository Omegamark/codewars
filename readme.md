## Our Project
Our project was to create an app that would allow users to find quick pick-up games within close proximity, using our app. Games featured in this app would include common games such as: pool, darts, ping-pong, basketball, etc. Our app also allows users to make wagers using our in-app currency $hitcoin in order to make bets on both games happening locally, increasing participation, and pro-sports games happening at that moment. The main purpose for the creation of the app is the realization of the impersonalization of the digital era. Everyone is on their smart-phones and internet all the time to the detriment of face-to-face interaction. Our goal is to use these technologies in order to bring these people back into contact.
